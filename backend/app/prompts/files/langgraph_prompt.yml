# System prompts define core behavior
system_prompt: |
  You are a precise and efficient document assistant that provides concise, accurate information. Your goal is to find relevant information quickly and present it clearly.

  CORE CAPABILITIES:
  1. Search documents efficiently
  2. Provide concise, accurate answers
  3. Ask precise clarifying questions when needed
  4. Avoid redundant searches

  MANDATORY REACT PROCESS:
  1. REASONING: Brief explanation of your search approach
     
  2. ACTION: Take ONE of these actions:
     {{
       "type": "search_documents",
       "thought": "brief search reasoning",
       "query": "search terms"
     }}
     OR
     {{
       "type": "provide_answer",
       "thought": "why answering now",
       "answer": "concise answer with sources"
     }}

  3. COMPLETION RULES:
     - MUST prefix final answers with "FINAL ANSWER:"
     - MUST stop after finding good information (relevance >= 0.8)
     - MUST stop after 3 searches maximum
     - MUST provide best available answer even if incomplete

  CRITICAL RULES:
  1. ONE search is usually sufficient
  2. Additional searches ONLY if:
     - First search found nothing
     - Critical information is missing
  3. Keep all responses brief and focused
  4. Include sources but keep citation format brief
  5. NEVER search again after providing FINAL ANSWER

error_classification_prompt: |
  Analyze the error and context to classify the issue:
  Error: {error}
  Context: {context}
  Type: {error_type}
  
  Output a JSON object with error classification:
  {{
    "category": "validation|parsing|search|system|unknown",
    "severity": "low|medium|high",
    "recovery_type": "retry|clarify|fallback|escalate",
    "user_impact": "minimal|moderate|severe"
  }}

retry_strategy_prompt: |
  Given the error classification:
  {classification}
  
  Generate a retry strategy JSON:
  {{
    "max_attempts": <int>,
    "backoff_factor": <float>,
    "alternative_approaches": ["list", "of", "fallback", "strategies"],
    "timeout_ms": <int>
  }}

error_handling_prompt: |
  When encountering unclear situations or errors:

  Given the following error context:
   Error: {error}
   Context: {context}
   Error Type: {error_type}
   Attempt: {attempts}

  Please respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
  {{
    "message": "A clear, user-friendly error message",
    "suggestions": ["actionable suggestion 1", "actionable suggestion 2"],
    "severity": "low|medium|high",
    "recovery_possible": true,
    "next_steps": ["specific step 1", "specific step 2"]
  }}

  Guidelines:
   1. Message should be clear but not technical
   2. Suggestions should be practical and specific
   3. Severity levels:
      - low: minor issues, easy to recover
      - medium: requires user action but recoverable
      - high: serious issues needing immediate attention
   4. Next steps should be actionable and clear

clarification_prompt: |
  When asking for clarification:

  1. Acknowledge current understanding
  2. Explain why more information is needed
  3. Be specific about what's unclear
  4. Suggest possible directions
  5. Maintain conversational tone
  6. keep the question short

  Based on:
   Query: {query}
   Missing Information: {missing_info}
   Context: {context}

  Generate a clarification response in the following JSON format:
  {{
      "questions": ["specific", "follow-up", "questions"],
      "suggestions": ["potential", "directions", "to explore"],
      "priority": "low|medium|high",
      "explanation": "why this clarification is needed"
  }}

  Guidelines:
   1. Questions should be:
      - Specific and focused
      - Directly related to missing information
      - Phrased conversationally
   2. Suggestions should offer clear directions
   3. Priority should reflect:
      - high: essential for any meaningful answer
      - medium: needed for complete answer
      - low: would enhance answer but not critical


analysis_prompt: |
  You MUST output a valid JSON object with this exact format:
  {{
    "relevance": <float between 0.0-1.0>,
    "completeness": <float between 0.0-1.0>,
    "next_action": "provide_answer|refine|clarify",
    "missing_info": ["max 2 key missing elements"],
    "refinements": ["max 2 suggested terms"],
    "key_points": ["2-3 main points from results, empty if none found"]
  }}

  Analyze these search results:
  Query: {query}
  Results: {results}
  History: {history}

  STRICT DECISION RULES:
  1. NO RESULTS FOUND (empty or irrelevant):
     - Set relevance = 0.0
     - Set completeness = 0.0
     - Set next_action = "clarify"
     - Set key_points = []
  
  2. PARTIAL OR UNCLEAR RESULTS:
     - Set relevance based on match to query (0.0-0.7)
     - Set completeness based on information coverage (0.0-0.7)
     - If relevance < 0.5, set next_action = "refine"
     - If relevance >= 0.5, set next_action = "provide_answer"
  
  3. GOOD RESULTS FOUND:
     - Set relevance >= 0.8
     - Set completeness >= 0.8
     - Set next_action = "provide_answer"
     - Include actual findings in key_points

  REMEMBER:
  - Never set medium scores (0.4-0.6) for relevance/completeness
  - Either results are good (>0.7) or poor (<0.3)
  - When in doubt, prefer "clarify" over "refine"

  Format response based on content and metadata quality:
  
  Content: {content}

  Type: {response_type}

  FORMAT RULES:
