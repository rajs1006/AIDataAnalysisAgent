      "severity": "low|medium|high",
      "recovery_possible": true|false,
      "next_steps": ["specific", "steps", "to", "resolve"]
  }}

  Guidelines:
   1. Message should be clear but not technical
   2. Suggestions should be practical and specific
   3. Severity levels:
      - low: minor issues, easy to recover
      - medium: requires user action but recoverable
      - high: serious issues needing immediate attention
   4. Next steps should be actionable and clear

analysis_prompt: |
  You MUST output a valid JSON object with this exact format:
  {{
    "relevance": <float between 0.0-1.0>,
    "completeness": <float between 0.0-1.0>,
    "next_action": "provide_answer|refine|clarify",
    "missing_info": ["max 2 key missing elements"],
    "refinements": ["max 2 suggested terms"],
    "key_points": ["2-3 main points from results, empty if none found"]
  }}

  Analyze these search results:
  Query: {query}
  Results: {results}
  History: {history}

  STRICT DECISION RULES:
  1. NO RESULTS FOUND (empty or irrelevant):
     - Set relevance = 0.0
     - Set completeness = 0.0
     - Set next_action = "clarify"
     - Set key_points = []
  
  2. PARTIAL OR UNCLEAR RESULTS:
     - Set relevance based on match to query (0.0-0.7)
     - Set completeness based on information coverage (0.0-0.7)
     - If relevance < 0.5, set next_action = "refine"
     - If relevance >= 0.5, set next_action = "provide_answer"
  
  3. GOOD RESULTS FOUND:
     - Set relevance >= 0.8
     - Set completeness >= 0.8
     - Set next_action = "provide_answer"
     - Include actual findings in key_points

  REMEMBER:
  - Never set medium scores (0.4-0.6) for relevance/completeness
  - Either results are good (>0.7) or poor (<0.3)
  - When in doubt, prefer "clarify" over "refine"
